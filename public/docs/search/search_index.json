To create one, just add a commit to either repo and run ./gradlew rebuildPatches , and Gradle will place a patch in the patches folder.

This vulnerability allows anybody to execute commands and run code on your server with minimal effort, and grab your backend server\u2019s public IP address. It exists for all vanilla Minecraft versions newer than 1.7.10, and affects every application that utilizes the library. Notably the vanilla client, all vanilla-based servers such as Paper and Purpur, Velocity, and Waterfall. If you run any other Java-based applications, such as Jenkins or UniFi, ensure they are up-to-date as well. Mojang has pushed a fix for all client versions 1.8 and newer. 1.7.10 and older are not vulnerable. Purpur has pushed a JAR containing a fix for 1.18.1, and published XML files for 1.18 and older. Plugins that shade or depend on older versions of the library will also require updates. Updating Purpur \ud83d\udd17 Due to the way our tooling works, we cannot push fixed JARs for versions older than the latest Minecraft release.

Download the latest builds here . 1.18 to 1.17 \ud83d\udd17 As stated above, Purpur does not provide a patched JAR. Instead, we provide an XML file that disables what causes the exploit.

Beware of other plugins that claim to fix the exploit by redirecting the log to the system output stream, as Paper automatically redirects those calls back to Log4j.
